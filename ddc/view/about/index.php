                It seemed like a lonely journey devoid of the presence of God, when Bishop Dag Heward-Mills began ministering the good news of Jesus Christ to the lost souls of the world. This vision has not faded, but has intensified to the point of desperation because Christ’s coming is imminent. This vision has birthed Lighthouse Chapel International and many other ministries, confirming the tangible presence and will of God. To God be all the glory as we remember and record our small beginnings and how far God has brought us.

                When he gained admission into the University of Ghana Medical School in October 1982, ‘Brother’ Dag as he was known as at the time, began a branch of Calvary Road Incorporated (CRI). This group was made up of young vibrant Christians reaching the world through Music and Drama. In that same year ‘Brother’ Dag met Sister Adelaide Baiden on campus during one of his many follow-up visits to her hall of residence while trying to start CRI.

                The group attracted both the curious and those hungry and thirsty for the Lord and one such person was ‘Brother’ EATS who turned up one November day in the same year at a CRI meeting. Inspired and burning with a zeal shared by ‘Brother’ Dag, EATS decided to join CRI.

                In the midst of this hostility, in 1986, Dawn Broadcasts were also started at the NTC’s House 10 where a lot of souls were won to Christ that dawn. These precious saints became the first members of CRI Korle-Bu branch. Finally heeding to the leading of the Holy Spirit to leave CRI and to begin a church, ‘Brother’ Dag made his assistant at Legon, the leader of CRI Korle-Bu. This was also in preparation for his imminent departure from CRI.

                The Korle-Bu branch soon began to meet for Sunday Services at the Korle-Bu Christian Centre and ‘Brother’ EAT preached at the first service at the Medical School Auditorium. Subsequent services however, were held at the school of Hygiene Lecture Room. This arrangement was short-lived because the Head of Anatomy Department refused to allow the fellowship to continue meeting at the auditorium. Even though the climate seemed discouraging and
                the prospects daunting, the fellowship continued to meet at the School of Hygiene Lecture Room on Sunday mornings and Tuesday evenings as well as having all-nights in the open forecourt of the Medical School Auditorium. As expected the church came under attack and persecution from Medical Students who claimed that their worship was a nuisance to them. Following on, a delegation of Medical Students led by a female met with the Dean of the
                Medical School, Professor Akyeampong requesting that the church be closed down or relocated.
